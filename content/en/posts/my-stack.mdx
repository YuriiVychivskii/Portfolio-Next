Over the past year, my development approach has evolved a lot. Before, I just looked for “whatever works”, but now I think more about **architecture, scalability, and user experience**. In this post, I’ll walk you through the technologies I use in my pet projects — especially Nimble, a subscription management service.

## ⚙️ Frontend

### **React**

> The library where it all began.

I’ve been writing React since 2023. I like its component-based approach and the ecosystem. I'm comfortable working with hooks, context, portals, `useReducer`, and more.

### **Next.js 14+ (App Router)**

> A modern framework with everything out of the box.

I switched to the App Router — it gives me SSR, SSG, API routes, layouts, and parallel rendering. I'm also learning newer features like `useOptimistic`, `server actions`, etc. I keep my `app` folder clean and organized.

### **Tailwind CSS**

> I write styles faster than I ever did with SCSS.

Tailwind has replaced Bootstrap and even plain CSS for me. I create custom UI components, follow a consistent style, and make everything responsive from the start. I also use Tailwind plugins like `@tailwind/forms` and `@tailwind/typography`.

### **SCSS (occasionally)**

> For highly customized styles or when I need variables.

## 🧠 State Management

### **Redux Toolkit**

> When I need centralized state management.

I use `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and `RTK Query` for API calls. I’ve also learned not to overengineer things — I don’t bring in Redux unless it’s truly needed.

### **Zustand (planned)**

> I’d like to try it for lighter use cases.

## 🔐 Authentication

### **NextAuth + Credentials + Google OAuth**

> I add login via email and Google account.

I’ve customized `signIn`, `signOut`, and built my own MongoDB backend. In the future, I plan to add user roles.

### **JWT**

> A standardized and reliable way to handle auth.

I store tokens in `httpOnly` cookies — it’s safer than using localStorage.

## 🧰 Other Tools

- **Axios** — for API requests (with a basic interceptor setup).
- **ESLint + Prettier** — for auto-formatting and consistent code style.
- **Git + GitHub** — my version control and collaboration workflow.
