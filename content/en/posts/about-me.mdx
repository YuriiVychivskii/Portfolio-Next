Hi! My name is **Yura**, I’m from Ivano-Frankivsk, and I’m a **frontend developer**. My path in IT started with a fascination for the web when I accidentally discovered HTML and CSS back in school. But I got serious about it during my studies at the **Professional College of Electronic Devices of IFNTUNG**, where I specialized in **automation and computer-integrated technologies**.

## 🎯 My Goal

I want to create interfaces that don’t just "look good", but **solve real problems**. I write clean, readable code using **React**, **Next.js**, **SCSS/Tailwind**, and I’m gradually learning backend, databases, and deployment tools.

## 🧠 What I've Done So Far

- Completed the **"Full JavaScript + React Course"** on Udemy by Ivan Petrychenko
- Built my first large-scale pet project — [**Nimble**](/projects/nimble) — a subscription management service
- Learned the basics of **Git/GitHub**, REST APIs, and responsive design
- Working with **JWT authentication**, **Formik/Yup**, **Redux Toolkit**
- Confident in HTML5, CSS3, React, and Next.js (v14+)

## 💡 What Is Nimble?

It's not just a pet project — it's an attempt to solve a real problem: **subscription chaos**. Nimble analyzes your Google/Apple accounts, calendars, imports your subscriptions, and reminds you before charges happen.  
The project is still in development, but I’m steadily moving toward an MVP and public release.

## 🔍 What’s Next?

I'm actively looking for **my first internship or junior position** to grow in a team, learn from experienced developers, and contribute my code to something meaningful. In the meantime, I continue exploring new tools, writing this blog, and shipping code.
