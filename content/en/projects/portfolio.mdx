## ✨ Project Overview

This is my **personal portfolio website**, built using modern web technologies like **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It represents me as a developer, showcases my projects (including Nimble), and allows recruiters or collaborators to learn more about my skills and contact me easily.
I designed it with **clarity**, **performance**, and **accessibility** in mind
— both for desktop and mobile users.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

## Next.js 14 (App Router)

A modern React framework that offers:

- server-side rendering (SSR),
- file-based routing with the `app` directory,
- support for persistent layouts and nested routes.

## React 18

A library for building dynamic user interfaces:

- component-based architecture,
- built-in state and lifecycle management,
- support for modern features like _Concurrent Mode_.

## Tailwind CSS

A utility-first CSS framework that helps:

- build responsive UIs quickly,
- avoid writing custom styles,
- customize your design via configuration.

## TypeScript

A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that brings:

- static typing during development,
- better editor support and autocompletion,
- improved code reliability and maintainability.

## Contentlayer + MDX

A powerful combo for working with content:

- **MDX** — Markdown with embedded JSX components,
- **Contentlayer** — generates types and content sources automatically,
- ideal for blogs, portfolios, or documentation.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

After building [**Nimble**](/projects/nimble), I wanted a space to present my projects and skills professionally.  
This portfolio site became a way to:

- Apply and solidify my Next.js and Tailwind knowledge
- Practice component-based architecture
- Learn how to work with MDX and content-driven pages
- Polish the UI/UX and write clean, production-ready code

---

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Add filter/search by tech stack or tags
- Use CMS like Notion or Sanity for live content
- Support i18n (English/Ukrainian switch)
- Add testimonials and timeline
- More advanced animations and micro-interactions
