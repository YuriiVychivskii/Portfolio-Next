## ✨ Project Overview

This is a **Marvel-themed web application** that allows users to browse, search, and explore Marvel characters using the official **Marvel API**.  
It’s built with **React**, **Axios**, and **custom SCSS styling**, and showcases API integration, error handling, and component-based architecture.

It’s a fun and interactive way to test and improve my frontend skills while working with a real-world public API.
